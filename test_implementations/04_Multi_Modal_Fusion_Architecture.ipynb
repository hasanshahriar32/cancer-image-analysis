    "# Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture with Attention Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Fusion Strategies - Phase 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion techniques to combine features from ultrasound, histopathological, and chest X-ray images. Target: **95-97% accuracy** through intelligent feature fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fusion Strategies Implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Early Fusion (Feature Concatenation)\n",
    "- Concatenate 2048-dim features from each CNN backbone\n",
    "- Create 6144-dimensional unified feature vector\n",
    "- Apply dimensionality reduction and feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Late Fusion (Decision-Level)\n",
    "- Independent classification from each modality\n",
    "- Ensemble voting with learned weights\n",
    "- Confidence-based decision fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Attention-Based Fusion\n",
    "- Cross-modal attention mechanisms\n",
    "- Dynamic modality weighting based on input characteristics\n",
    "- Adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Hierarchical Fusion Networks\n",
    "- Multi-scale feature extraction and fusion\n",
    "- Progressive fusion from low to high-level features\n",
    "- Residual fusion connections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Innovations:\n",
    "- **Cross-Modal Attention**: Learn which modality is most informative for each case\n",
    "- **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamic fusion weights based on image quality and content\n",
    "- **Spectral-Aware Fusion**: Incorporate RGB/HSV/Jet spectral information\n",
    "- **Clinical Relevance**: Mimic radiologist decision-making process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Targets:\n",
    "- **Early Fusion**: 95-96% accuracy baseline\n",
    "- **Late Fusion**: 96-97% accuracy with ensemble benefits\n",
    "- **Attention Fusion**: 97%+ accuracy with optimized attention\n",
    "- **Combined Strategy**: Foundation for 98%+ GA-optimized performance\n",
