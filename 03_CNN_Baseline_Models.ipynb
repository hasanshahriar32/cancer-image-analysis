    "# CNN Baseline Models for Individual Modalities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single-Modality Deep Learning Baselines - Phase 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements individual CNN architectures for each imaging modality to establish baseline performance before multi-modal fusion. Based on literature review, we expect **85-92% accuracy** for individual modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Selection:\n",
    "- **Ultrasound Images (806 samples)**: DenseNet-121 → Target: 92-95% accuracy\n",
    "- **Histopathological Images (1,246 samples)**: ResNet-50 → Target: 94-97% accuracy  \n",
    "- **Chest X-ray Images (1,000 samples)**: EfficientNet-B5 → Target: 88-92% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Strategy:\n",
    "1. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained ImageNet weights with fine-tuning\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract 2048-dim features from penultimate layer\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold validation for robust performance assessment\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Learning rate, batch size, dropout optimization\n",
    "5. **Performance Analysis**: Detailed metrics and error analysis per modality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Contributions:\n",
    "- Individual modality baselines for comparison\n",
    "- Optimal CNN architecture selection per modality  \n",
    "- Feature vectors for subsequent multi-modal fusion\n",
    "- Performance benchmarks for GA optimization targets\n",
