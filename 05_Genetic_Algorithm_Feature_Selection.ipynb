    "# Genetic Algorithm-Optimized Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evolutionary Feature Optimization - Phase 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the core innovation of our research: **Genetic Algorithm-based feature selection** adapted from blockchain optimization literature to multispectral breast cancer classification. Target: **98-99.5% accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GA Configuration (Optimized from Literature):\n",
    "- **Population Size**: 50 chromosomes (optimal balance of diversity vs. computation)\n",
    "- **Generations**: 10 generations (sufficient for convergence based on blockchain paper)\n",
    "- **Mutation Rate**: 20% (optimal rate identified in ablation studies)\n",
    "- **Crossover Rate**: 80% (standard genetic algorithm parameter)\n",
    "- **Fitness Function**: Classification accuracy with complexity penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Multi-Dimensional Feature Space\n",
    "- **CNN Features**: 2048-dim per modality × 3 modalities = 6144 features\n",
    "- **Spectral Features**: RGB/HSV/Jet channels × 3 = 9 additional feature channels\n",
    "- **Total Feature Space**: ~15,360 dimensional feature vectors\n",
    "- **Target Reduction**: Select optimal 5-10 features (99%+ dimensionality reduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Chromosome Encoding\n",
    "- **Binary Encoding**: Each gene represents feature inclusion/exclusion\n",
    "- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance accuracy vs. feature count\n",
    "- **Elite Preservation**: Keep top 10% performers across generations\n",
    "- **Diversity Maintenance**: Prevent premature convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Advanced Selection Operators\n",
    "- **Tournament Selection**: Select parents based on fitness competition\n",
    "- **Elitism**: Preserve best solutions across generations\n",
    "- **Adaptive Mutation**: Dynamic mutation rate based on population diversity\n",
    "- **Multi-Point Crossover**: Exchange multiple feature segments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Performance Gains:\n",
    "Based on blockchain paper results showing **99.47% accuracy** with GA optimization:\n",
    "- **Without GA**: 95-97% accuracy (multi-modal fusion baseline)\n",
    "- **With GA**: 98-99.5% accuracy target (matching/exceeding literature)\n",
    "- **Feature Reduction**: 99%+ dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance\n",
    "- **Computational Efficiency**: Faster inference with minimal features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Research Contributions:\n",
    "1. **Novel Application**: First GA-based feature selection for multispectral medical images\n",
    "2. **Performance Breakthrough**: Target >99% accuracy on breast cancer classification\n",
    "3. **Clinical Utility**: Minimal feature set for real-time clinical deployment\n",
    "4. **Methodological Innovation**: Bridge between evolutionary computation and deep learning\n",
